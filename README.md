# Vacuoles_segmentation
Matlab functions to segment and quantify vacuoles in histological images.

The algorithm was developed in MATLAB R2016B, using the Image Processing toolbox. 
Image segmentation was performed using Otsuâ€™s thresholding method (T=0.7). 
Only round vacuoles with an area in the range of [200 pixels, 2000 pixels] and with a shape values > 0.9 
(where shape was calculated as shape = (4*PI*Area) / (Perimeter^2)) were quantified.
